Abstract:
Humanity is faced with the inevitable concept of the end. The interesting aspects of the end are that which involve questions about how it comes about, in a timely or untimely manner. These lead to further questions regarding what is considered "timely"; the aim being to quantitatively and definitively understand these concepts through data mining techniques. Through analysis, several captivating questions about the nature of society and lifespan in humans, such as: 
Among famous personalities, is the percentage of death by suicide more skewed towards either gender?
Which occupations involve a higher degree of accidents leading to death?
Has the general life expectancy of famous people increased with time?
Given information about a person, such as country and year of birth, gender, and occupation, can we predict oneâ€™s lifespan? 
The results of such questions allowed for some insight as to the following: professions which correlated with a higher expected lifespan such as artists, researchers, and doctors; the nature and factors (notably gender) of rare event deaths such as suicide; the prediction of how lifespan may be affected given the roles of gender, occupation, a description of the individual in question, country of origin, as well as time period in which the individual lived.
