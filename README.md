Abstract:
  Humanity is faced with the inevitable concept of the end. The interesting aspects of the end are that which involve questions about how it comes about, in a timely or untimely manner. These lead to further questions regarding what is considered "timely"; the aim being to quantitatively and definitively understand these concepts through data mining techniques. Through analysis, several captivating questions about the nature of society and lifespan in humans, such as: 
Among famous personalities, is the percentage of death by suicide more skewed towards either gender?
Which occupations involve a higher degree of accidents leading to death?
Has the general life expectancy of famous people increased with time?
Given information about a person, such as country and year of birth, gender, and occupation, can we predict oneâ€™s lifespan? 
The results of such questions allowed for some insight as to the following: professions which correlated with a higher expected lifespan such as artists, researchers, and doctors; the nature and factors (notably gender) of rare event deaths such as suicide; the prediction of how lifespan may be affected given the roles of gender, occupation, a description of the individual in question, country of origin, as well as time period in which the individual lived. 

Application:
  The knowledge gained from our results may be utilized in consideration for the evolution of life expectancy. It is interestingly noted that certain professions are rather indicative of a longer lifespan. Choosing a profession, along with general success regarding a profession, is highly indicative of a longer lifespan. As such, career counselors/coaches, physicians, and talent managers may take this into consideration when assessing which jobs end up having humans live longest. The benefits of such may either entice people to join a career as an artist (so long as they are prolific), or may allow for a recommendation to be made given an individual/group preference for job security and life longevity. Another interesting result found was the correlation of rare event deaths such as suicide. The so-called "mid-life crisis" as applicable to mental health issues seems to hold some truth when considering the mean age of those who ended up with a CoD of suicide. To again reference physicians, it may give some indication of an imperative to focus on an age group of people nearing the age range as this result has been found to be consistent across contemporary society since the 19th century. An extension of the work would be to cross this data set with some of the other data sets mentioned in the literary reviews; the prior work done to regard some classifiers for gender based on names was an interesting idea that ended up not being as fully implemented as hoped. Another extension that would be interesting would be the further classification regarding the CoD of a rare event such as suicide to match more closely with the medical reports given would allow for some ubiquity as needed.
